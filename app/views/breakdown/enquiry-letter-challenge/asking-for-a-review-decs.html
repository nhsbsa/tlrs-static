          We understand that you may have made an honest mistake and didn’t mean to do anything wrong.

            We won't usually review your enquiry letter if:

        <ul class="list list-bullet">

<li>your exemption certificate had expired</li>
<li>you feel that you were misadvised by your GP or by pharmacy staff</li>
<li>you thought that your benefit entitled you to claim</li>
<li>you thought your prescription prepayment certificate would automatically renew</li>
</ul>
 <h3 class="heading-medium">What to do next </h3>

<p>If you have an exceptional reason why you made the claim at the time, you can <a href="how-review-enquiry-decs copy.html">contact us to review your enquiry letter.</a> </p>

 <h3 class="heading-medium">If you’re not entitled to a review </h3>

<p>You will be sent a penalty charge notice.</p>
